(JULY 23, 2019) &amp;ndash; One of the big reasons Bitcoin hasn&amp;rsquo;t replaced traditional currency is that the original protocol behind the currency made it too cryptic for people to understand, and too impractical for daily use. The Swiss Shakti Foundation, a grassroots organization behind the Shakti Coin, developed a next-generation protocol that demystifies cryptocurrency by humanizing it.Shakti Coin is different from any other digital currency, using a Proof-of-Effort (PoE) Protocol instead of a Proof of Work (PoW) Protocol. Shakti Coin&amp;rsquo;s industry-changing PoE Protocol rewards families worldwide with a Shakti Coin for each day their child attends school. The way Shakti Coins are mined was designed to make mining easier, energy-efficient, and done by community members, all while creating a system designed to decimate child poverty on a global scale.Similar to other digital currencies, mission Shakti is intended to not only provide a financial means and inclusion for millions of people without a traditional bank account but also eradicate poverty by significantly improving school attendance. </apxh:p><apxh:p> &amp;ldquo;If we want to see better local, national, and global distribution of wealth, then we need a legally-compliant financial infrastructure to make that happen,&amp;rdquo; said Cathy Anthony, with the Swiss Shakti Foundation. &amp;ldquo;The Shakti Coin project will contribute here as a major catalyst for positive social change.&amp;rdquo; The way Shakti Coin works is easy to understand. For every day, a child goes to school, and the parents receive one Shakti Coin, which has a pronounced and fixed value of USD 5. Verifiers receive a micro-payment to verify the attendance, community members validate schoolchildren&amp;rsquo;s participation, and then parents collect their Shakti Coin. Shakti Coins can be used at a growing network of businesses. Moreover, participating schools also earn micro-payments to be used on school improvements.In a very real sense, every Shakti Coin mined represents an investment in humanitys intellectual capital. It is the first digital currency that harnesses technology to do social good.About Shakti CoinThe Shakti Coin project is an international grassroots initiative that exists independent of any affiliation with industry, government, religion or political party.

&amp;ndash;Cryptocurrencies from Big Firms are Focused on Getting Rich Quick Over Social GoodBERKELEY, Calif. (July 16th, 2019) &amp;ndash; The Swiss Shakti Foundation, a public benefit grassroots organization behind the Shakti Coin, presents a novel approach to cryptocurrency that is markedly different from Facebook&amp;rsquo;s planned Libra coin. Shakti Coins are stable coins that are uniquely mined, coin-by-coin, through cooperative efforts. It&amp;rsquo;s tied to children attending schools, which then allows the schoolchildren to earn Shakti Coins which can aid their educational programs. Libra is structured as a payments-focused cryptocurrency scheduled for launch in 2020. It&amp;rsquo;s a big step for Facebook to create its own currency. Shakti Coin is different because its sole purpose is to fund schools as a way to improve access to education around the globe. Mining Shakti Coin doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any specialized computing equipment or usage of massive amounts of electricity since it&amp;rsquo;s tied to human activity. Parents with a child attending schools can also mine the coin through Shakti Network&amp;rsquo;s Proof-of-Effort (POE) protocol. Shakti Coin is a stable coin with a set $5 USD value per coin. This amount will never change, which effectively removes all of the volatility in the currency as well as the risk of loss for its holders. The &amp;lsquo;&amp;rsquo;unbanked&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; need a hand-up, not a hand-grab nor can they afford to trust anyone to take care of their few cents they may have. The world&amp;rsquo;s poor requires a bottom-up approach that could re-kindle their belief system and their inner self-confidence for generations to come. That can only be achieved through education. &amp;ldquo;The Libra announcement and all of the attention on cryptocurrency and the blockchain have certainly raised the industry&amp;rsquo;s profile,&amp;rdquo; said Gary, a contributing voluntary member of the grassroots movement. &amp;ldquo;However, it is important to note that big companies such as Facebook entering into crypto for financial gains, not-to-mention their ability to seep into even more ingrained into the daily lives of humanity. They see economic benefits on the backs of the poorest of the poor -- any social good is a gravy train for marketing spin. Whereas Shakti is different because we&amp;rsquo;ve tied the mining of the coin directly to the school participation. Education is the only way for communities to advanceout of poverty, so we&amp;rsquo;re taking direct action where help is needed by supporting schools and creating opportunities for the 1.7 Billion unbanked around the world.&amp;rdquo; About Shakti: Shakti is an international grassroots movement that exists independent of any affiliation with any industry, any government, any religious or any political affinity.

Going back to the basics, what was the goal of globalization? To improve the quality of life for those who belong to the marginal communities across the world, whether they live in developed or developing countries. Let &amp;rsquo;s unpack it with a practical question for the benefit of economic policy advisors and leaders of thoughts; how many Automotive Engineers can change engine oil? Probably, almost everyone can if they want to do it. They have the intellect, hands-on experience with ongoing professional training, and above all, access to knowledgeable friends just a phone call away. Moreover, automakers design their vehicles for ordinary people to follow do-it -yourself instructions for performing essential maintenance such as changing the engine oil. Almost all car owne rs can chan ge the oil if they&amp;rsquo;re willing to, irrespective of them being an automotive engineer. </apxh:p><apxh:p>  </apxh:p><apxh:p> But almost everyone will fail miserably without the appropriate tool! On the other hand, if they all haveaccess to hydraulic lift or ramp, all of them will becapable of changing the engine oil. Any attempt to get the same job done withoutthe necessary equipmentto perform the same task&amp;mdash;such as a manualor a hi-liftscissor jack or a portable ramp will break their backs.That&amp;rsquo;s why 90% of the world&amp;rsquo;s population lives on hand-to-mouth&amp;mdash;paycheque to paychequebecause they are all using the wrong tool to exchange their valuables around the globe. There is no going back to the globalizationwe once deemed possible.We no longer can work with a relic monetary tool if we wish to see the marginalized families livetotheir full potential. The global population needs a single currency that&amp;rsquo;s available to all. The currency should bepractical, easy to use, and simple enough forpeople across the world tounderstand it,see it, touch it and enjoy thebenefitsof using it. Moreover, every time that &amp;ldquo;single&amp;rdquo; currency getsused, it must aid and add material value in the lives ofordinary human beings&amp;mdash;not just forthe ultra-rich. ShaktiCoinis one such currency&amp;mdash;its protocol is transparent and straightforward. It issmart, practical, and as powerful as the hydraulic lift. Further, it is easily understood by those who need it most. This blockchain-poweredcryptocurrency fixes school attendance and extendsfinancial inclusionto the weakest byusing a new protocol&amp;mdash;Proof-of-Effort (PoE).Thiswill propel every family on the planet Earth to educate their children and reward those who tryevery day. </apxh:p><apxh:p>  </apxh:p><apxh:p> Shakti Coin&amp;rsquo;s four-part whitepaper defines the various social and economic benefitsthat it offersto communities,with itsstable coin ecosystem.About Shakti Coin:The Shakti Coin project is an international grassroots initiative that exists independent of any affiliation with industry, government, religion or political party.

(JULY 31, 2019) &amp;mdash; For 20 years we&amp;rsquo;ve been told that globalization will change the world and level the playing field. Instead, in the last two decades, we have witnessed the rich get richer, and the poor become poorer. What went wrong?Quite simply, while technology allowed us to connect globally, the relic monetary system impeded humanity&amp;rsquo;s progress. Shakti Coin, a unique crypto currency based on a Proof-of -Effort (PoE) protocol pegged to the U.S. dollar is the missing link to let the globalization prosper -- Shakti a global tool for a global economy.With traditional currency, if you work remotely for someone in South Africa and you live in the United States, by the time you get paid &amp;ndash; upwards of 15% is gone for exchange fees. With Shakti currency, near-zero transaction fees, and immediate transfer of value &amp;ndash; the global economy rocks. Reliable connectivity is essential for a global economy; the way Shakti Coins are mined and generatedalso contribute to the intellectual growth and success of everyone worldwide. The founders strongly believe a solid education is a way to eradicate poverty and empower an individual&amp;rsquo;s success. They looked at Switzerland, a small country with a big priority on &amp;lsquo;&amp;rsquo; Education For All&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; as a model for the global population to follow. Understanding how the Shakti Coin works is easy. For every day, a child goes to school, the parents receive one Shakti Coin, which has a pronounced fixed value of $5. Verifiers receive a micropayment to verify the attendance, and the children&amp;rsquo;s parents earn one Shakti Coin. Then, the Shakti Coins can be used at the growing network of businesses as a medium of exchange. In addition, participating schools can also earn micro-payments to be used on school improvements.&amp;ldquo;In some countries, one Shakti Coin can feed a whole family for the day,&amp;rdquo; said Gary, a contributing volunteer with the Swiss Shakti Foundation. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s enough to sustain a family, but not enough to make anyone rich. Therefore the family is incentivized to keep the child attending school.&amp;rdquo;About Shakti Coin:The Shakti Coin project is an international grassroots initiative that exists independent of any affiliation with industry, government, religion or political party.
